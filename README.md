# 07-Glitch-Garden
In this section we create a lane-based Tower Defense game modelled on the iconic Plants Vs Zombies game. We cover a lot of Unity's animation system, a resource management mechanic, specialised enemy types and more.

# Complete Unity Developer 2D - Glitch Garden

This is the [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub) - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught nearly half a million students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Complete Unity Developer](http://gdev.tv/cudgithub)
