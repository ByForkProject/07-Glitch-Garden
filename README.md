# 07-Glitch-Garden
In this section we create a lane-based Tower Defense game modelled on the iconic Plants Vs Zombies game. We cover a lot of Unity's animation system, a resource management mechanic, specialised enemy types and more. This repo is part of our Complete Unity C# Developer 2D course (http://gdev.tv/cudgithub). (Ref: GL_CUD)
